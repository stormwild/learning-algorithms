# Logarithm

Remember exponentials


10<sup>2</sup> = 100

log<sub>10</sub>100 = 2

log<sub>2</sub>8 = 3

2<sup>3</sup> = 2 * 2 * 2 = 8;

"How many 10s do we multiple to get 100?"

In the context of runtime performance in Big O Notation log always means log<sub>2</sub>

When searching for an element `k` in in an ordered sequence `n` where `1 <= k <= n`.

A simple search would be in the order of `n` or `O(n)`.

This means if the sequence is `n = 8`, then we would have to check up to `8` numbers at the most.

When using Binary Search, we would have a run time in the order of `O(log n)`.
